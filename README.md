## **What is defined as Quality Media?**
 -I define quality media as type of media which to be able to produced and create a narrative requires a cumilative effort for various creative minds alongside with a budget this consist of:
   --Films/TV Series
   --Comics/Mangas
   --Story Driven Video Games
-Social Media's I primarily use
   --Youtube
   --Reddit
   --Instagram

---
## **Motivation**
   - I am aiming to figure out relation between my two types of media consumption and in the end want to find the answer my which social media site consumption hinders my quality media consumption the most.
   - I also want to differantiate my media consumption by Work Day/Holiday
